<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<div class="M">
<p>
  Panorama Montessori School (PMS) was founded in 1985 on a 5,000-square-meter lot in Panorama Ville Subdivision, Barangay Dita, Santa Rosa, Laguna by Mrs. Teodora Bayani Matic, its owner and founding president.<br><br>
  In 1989, the school expanded to a 4,000-square-meter campus located along the National Highway in Canlalay, Biñan, Laguna. Initially, it opened three classes—Junior Casa, Junior Advanced Casa, and Advanced Casa—with 54 students enrolled. The steady growth in enrollment over the following years led to the construction of a two-story building and the addition of more classes each year.<br><br>
  By 1993–1994, computer lessons were introduced to Grades 3 to 6. The first batch of Grade 6 students graduated in March 1994, with PMSI achieving a 100% passing rate in the National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT). Continuing its commitment to academic excellence, PMSI opened its High School Department in School Year 1996–1997, welcoming its first 17 students.<br><br>
  Panorama Montessori School follows the Montessori method, a lifelong approach to education that nurtures children from preschool to adolescence. The school integrates Montessori learning principles with the prescribed conventional basic education curriculum of the Philippines, ensuring a holistic and well-rounded academic foundation.<br><br>
  The Montessori philosophy, pioneered by Dr. Maria Montessori, emphasizes the importance of fostering independence, exploration, and meaningful learning. Rooted in her early work with children in pediatric psychology, this approach continues to inspire the educational practices of Panorama Montessori School, guiding every child toward growth, discovery, and lifelong learning.<br><br>
